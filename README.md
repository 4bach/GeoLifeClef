Automatically predicting the list of species that are the most likely to be observed at a given location is useful for 
many scenarios in biodiversity informatics. First of all, it could improve species identification processes and tools 
by reducing the list of candidate species that are observable at a given location (be they automated, semi-automated 
or based on classical field guides or flora). More generally, it could facilitate biodiversity inventories through the 
development of location-based recommendation services (typically on mobile phones) as well as the involvement of 
non-expert nature observers. Last but not least, it might serve educational purposes thanks to biodiversity discovery 
applications providing functionalities such as contextualized educational pathways.
